import * as z from 'zod';

// Example: If you had a specific validation for fetching a customer by ID
export const getCustomerByIdSchema = z.object({
  params: z.object({
    customerId: z.string().uuid({ message: "Invalid customer ID format." }),
  }),
});

// You could also re-export or adapt schemas from shared-types if they are directly relevant here
// For instance, if you wanted to keep a local reference or slightly adapt it:
// import { signUpSchema as sharedSignUpSchema } from '@dembegna/shared-types';
// export const customerSignUpSchema = sharedSignUpSchema; // Or adapt it

// For now, most customer creation validation will be handled by the auth module's signUpSchema
